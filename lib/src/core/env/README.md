### Env obfuscation

 If these urls is sensitive, the file generated by this
 flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs 
 command can be included inside .gitignore file

 The values inside app_env_fields.dart and env.dart can be accessed by the app
 because env.g.dart file that stores the obfuscated values is uploaded to repository
 while .env file is not uploaded to github repository because it is purposed to 
 available within local machine
